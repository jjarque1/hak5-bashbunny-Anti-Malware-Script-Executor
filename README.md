---

## Description

The **Anti-Malware Script Executor** is a payload designed to run a basic malware detection script on a Windows machine. It identifies potentially malicious processes and files, demonstrating how malware can be detected using built-in tools like PowerShell. This payload can be used as a part of a security audit to highlight suspicious activity on a system.

## How it Works

1. The payload launches PowerShell with administrator privileges.
2. It runs commands to identify:
   - Suspicious processes that match certain patterns or keywords.
   - Files on the system that match typical malware names or indicators.
3. The results of the scan are saved in a log file.
4. The log file is copied to the Bash Bunny's storage for later analysis.

## Requirements

- Target: Windows machine
- Bash Bunny in HID and storage mode
